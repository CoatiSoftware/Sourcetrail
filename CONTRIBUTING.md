# Contributing
If you like this project and want to get involved, there are lots of ways you can help:

* __Spread the word.__ The more people want this project to grow, the greater the motivation for the developers to get things done.
* __Fund the development.__ Further development and maintenance of this project is crowd funded via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/sourcetrail). If you would like Sourcetrail to grow and improve but cannot spare the time to contribute your self, please consider making a pledge.
* __Test Sourcetrail.__ Run it on your own source code. If you find any issues, just report it here. Best, include some detailed step-by-step instructions that illustrate how to reproduce the issue, so that we can use it as a basis to craft a test case for our continuous integration and no one will ever break that case again.
* __Write some code.__ Don't be shy here. You can implement whole new features or fix some bugs, but you can also do some refactoring if you think that it benefits the readability or the maintainability of the code. Still, no matter if you just want to work on cosmetics or implement new features, it would be best if you create an issue here on the issue tracker before you actually start handing in pull requests, so that we can discuss those changes first and thus raise the probability that those changes will get pulled quickly.

To create a pull request, follow these steps:
* Fork the Repo on GitHub.
* Make your commits.
* If you added functionality or fixed a bug, please add a test.
* Add your name to the AUTHORS.txt file.
* Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
