# How to Build

Building Sourcetrail requires several dependencies to be in place on your machine. However, our CMake based setup allows to disable indexing support for specific languages which reduces the number of dependencies to a minimum.

## Building the bare minimum

### Required Tools

#### Git

This is required for generating the Sourcetrail version number. Get it from: https://git-scm.com/download.

Make sure `git` is available in added to your `PATH` environment variable.

#### CMake v3.12

This is used for generating a build configuration. Get it from: https://cmake.org/download/

### Additional tools for Windows

#### Visual Studio

### Additional tools for Unix

#### ccache

This is optionally used to speed up rebuilds if found in `PATH`.

### Required dependencies

#### Boost 1.67
For the __msvc__ compiler pre-built binaries can be downloaded from [sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/)

For building on Unix:
```
$ ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=filesystem,program_options,system,date_time
$ ./b2 --link=static --variant=release --threading=multi --runtime-link=static --cxxflags=-fPIC
```

#### Qt 5.12

__Note__: still causes style issues on Windows, resort to Qt 5.10

For the __msvc__ compiler pre-built binaries can be downloaded from [download.qt.io/official_releases/qt](http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/)

### Building

#### For Windows / Visual Studio
```
$ cd Sourcetrail
$ mkdir -p build/win64
$ cd build/win64
$ cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DBOOST_ROOT=<path/to/boost_1_68_0> -DQt5_DIR=<path/to/Qt/version/platform/compiler/lib/cmake/Qt5> ../..
```
If you are using the gui, we recommend that you activate advanced mode. Also you may be required to add some of the defines via the "Add Entry" button.

After generating the build configuration, just open the Sourcetrail.sln file that was generated by CMake and build the Sourcetrail project.

#### For Unix

```
$ cd Sourcetrail
$ mkdir -p build/Release
$ cd build/Release
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -DBOOST_ROOT=<path/to/boost_1_68_0> -DQt5_DIR=<path/to/Qt/version/platform/compiler/lib/cmake/Qt5> ../..
$ make Sourcetrail
```

### Running

Run Sourcetrail from within the build directory. During execution Sourcetrail needs resources from `bin/app/data` and `bin/app/user`. Cmake creates symlinks to these directories within the build directory.


## Enable C/C++ Language Support

### Required dependencies

#### LLVM/Clang 8.0.1

##### Windows
For the __msvc__ compiler, follow [these steps](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) to build the project and make sure that you run the cmake command exactly as described.

##### Unix
For Unix, follow this [installation guide](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibASTMatchersTutorial.html)

Build with `-DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON`.

### Building

Run CMake with these additional options:
```
-DClang_DIR=<path/to/llvm_build/lib/cmake/clang>
-DBUILD_CXX_LANGUAGE_PACKAGE=ON
```

## Enable Java Language Support

### Required dependencies

#### JDK 1.8

Install JDK and make sure the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set:
```
JAVA_HOME=.../Java/jdk1.x.x_xxx
```

Also make sure `<jdk_root>/bin` is available in your `PATH` environmen variable.

### Building

Run CMake with these additional options:
```
-DBUILD_JAVA_LANGUAGE_PACKAGE=ON
```


## Enable Python Language Support

### Required dependencies

#### WinRAR (for Windows only)

### Building

Run CMake with these additional options:
```
-DBUILD_PYTHON_LANGUAGE_PACKAGE=ON
```

## Packaging

### Windows

#### Required Tools

##### Visual Studio

##### Wix 3.11

##### Wix extension for Visual Studio

##### WinRAR

Make sure to append these directories to your `PATH` environment variable:
* VisualStudio/Common7/Tools
* VisualStudio/Common7/IDE
* .../Microsoft SDKs/Windows/v7.1A/Bin (for uuidgen in deploy script)
* .../WiX Toolset v3.11/bin
* .../WinRAR

Run `./script/deploy_windows.sh` script which will generate 32bit/64bit builds and packages these into a portable `.zip` file and a Wix-based Windows installer, each.

### macOS

After building, run the `bundle_install.sh` script within the build directory which will create a `Sourcetrail.app` bundle and generate a `Sourcetrail_<version>.dmg` container.

### Linux

Run `./script/buildonly.sh package`


# How to Run the Tests

The automated test suite of Sourcetrail is powered by [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2). To run the tests, simply execute the `Sourcetrail_test` binary. Before executing, please make sure to set the working directory to `./bin/test`.
